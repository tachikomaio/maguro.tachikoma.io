Dependency Update as a Service
==============================

Tachikoma.io will get rid of your dependency hell. Dependency update
is not what you want to do! You want to write application!

Just leave what Tachikoma.io can do and do what you want to do.

Everyone knows it is good to continue to use the latest
libraries/programming language, but what's stopping them?
---------------------------------------------------------

We know it is good to continue to use the latest libraries/programming
language. We enjoy new library features, increase in speed, and other
benefits. Everyone knows this, but what's stopping them?

I believe it's due to the lack of tools and integrations.



Interval pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interval _pull request_ is performing automatic, with strategy
"Bundler", "David", "Carton" if you set.



One click
~~~~~~~~~

What we only do is pressing merge button because this app sends pull
request with updating dependencies.



Judgement by human
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a human job that passes test and confirms diff.

What is Tachikoma.io
--------------------

Not updating the dependent libraries, does not damage the
library/application immediately. When adding a new library that you
want to use, occurring a security issue in a library which is already
in use, it is extremely difficult to find the right version that
functions properly with it. Even if you find the right combination,
it's very reactionary and it even gets harder when adding the next
one. Furthermore, sometimes with an older version, you won't be able
to enjoy new library features, increase in speed, updated version of
Ruby/Node.js/etc., and other benefits. Ultimately, choosing the
latest(stable) combination periodically will keep damages to a
minimum. Everyone knows this, but what's stopping them?

I believe it's due to the lack of tools and integrations. That is
where Tachikoma.io comes in.
