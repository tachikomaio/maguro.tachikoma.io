    "Not updating the dependent libraries, does not damage the library/application immediately. When adding a new library that you want to use, occurring a security issue in a library which is already in use, it is extremely difficult to find the right version that functions properly with it. Even if you find the right combination, it's very reactionary and it even gets harder when adding the next one. Furthermore, sometimes with an older version, you won't be able to enjoy new library features, increase in speed, updated version of Ruby/Node.js/etc., and other benefits. Ultimately, choosing the latest(stable) combination periodically will keep damages to a minimum. Everyone knows this, but what's stopping them?": "",
